# Shutdowner
An easy to use shutdown app for Windows
## Why?
Needed an easier app to do scheduled shutdowns / restarts
## Usage:
Simply enter the amount of hours and of minutes you want the computer to wait until it shuts down / restarts and click "Do it".

If you want to abort a schedule that's been already created, use the "Abort last" button.
